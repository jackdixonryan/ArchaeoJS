# ArchaeoJS
Archaeo again, but this time, in JS 


# THE _VIBE_ 

Welcome to the Mainframe: An ancient interface window left behind by beings long before our time. Riddled with bugs and spectres of the past, it is a dangerous place to seek information. Players must learn to play. Options include:

1. Mine ancient blocks for computational resources (mining)
2. Learn to write scripts themselves (smithing)
3. Create new and useful tools for delicate work (crafting)
4. Hack into systems they're not supposed to see (thieving)
5. Kill certain daemons (slayer) 
6. Build entirely new systems from scratch (construction) 
7. Fight and destroy daemons and ghosts in the code (attack, defense, strength, ranged, constitution) 
8. Decipher ancient languages
